**Background and Problem Statement:**<br />
Searching for furniture is a surprisingly time-consuming and mundane process. There are multiple different furniture retailers such as Ikea and HipVan which have a high volume of furniture in their catalogs. Typically, people would spend hours browsing through the catalogs trying to find something they would like, or spend hours visiting the physical stores in an attempt to find something that fits into the theme of their new apartment. Often, people may draw inspiration when they unexpectedly come across a nice piece of furniture, and decide they want to own a similar piece. The problem statement surfaces: Where can I find something similar to this piece of furniture? Does Ikea or HipVan have something similar?<br />
<br />
This presents the problem statement the team would be trying to tackle. Given an input RGB image of certain household objects or furniture, develop a computer vision system to return images of similar objects or furniture from Ikea and HipVan catalog. The computer vision system would include an object detector module and an image similarity module, neatly packaged into a telegram bot as the user interface. This system can help users narrow down quickly which major furniture vendor the user should visit, and help make the entire furniture hunting process more efficient.<br />
